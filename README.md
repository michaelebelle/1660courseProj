# 1660courseProj
1. Building the terminal application. It is quite simple as it simply asks the user which service they would like to use.
2. Building the dockerfile for this application. I used the same format as the dockerfile from our second assignment.
3. Searching/Pulling/Testing Docker containers. I had to find docker containers that would run the applications needed for the main application.
4. Building yaml files. Used the extra credit assignment as reference. 
5. Deploying the containers
